# 1 Introduction

The purpose is to describe the general subject area, state the research problem of interest, outline the main results of the thesis, and put the results in context with wider subject area and its applications.

The main body of the text must be divided into a logical scheme which is followed consistently throughout the work. It usually starts with an introduction chapter and ends with a conclusion.
